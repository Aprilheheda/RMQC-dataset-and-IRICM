# RMQC-dataset-and-IRICM
Overview
    This repository provides the Rock Mass Quality Classification (RMQC) dataset and the associated codes for model construction and evaluation. The dataset was compiled from field investigations and indoor interpretations, and is designed to support research on rock mass quality assessment, classification, and machine learning-based prediction models.
Tunnel and slope point cloud data can be found in the Baidu network disk link.
